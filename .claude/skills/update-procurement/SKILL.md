description: Ingest new public-procurement (АОП) data from data.egov.bg into data/procurement/. Use when the daily watch report flags "data.egov.bg АОП", "АОП debarred-suppliers register", or "ЦАИС ЕОП open data" (the storage.eop.bg flat-договори gap-fill) as changed, when the user asks to refresh procurement data, backfill prior periods, or investigate flagged contracts (huge amounts, canary mismatch). Also use after a fresh clone if data/procurement/ is empty.

# Update Procurement skill

Pulls АОП (Агенция за обществени поръчки) fortnightly OCDS-standard bundles from `data.egov.bg`, normalizes each release into flat `Contract` rows, and writes canonical JSON to `data/procurement/`. Optionally uploads to the GCS bucket.

## When to run

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Daily watcher reports `data.egov.bg АОП: N new fortnight bundle(s) on top` | Incremental ingest (`npm run procurement:ingest`) |
| Daily watcher reports `data.egov.bg АОП: N new annual contracts dataset(s)` | Legacy discovery (`npm run procurement:ingest-legacy -- --discover`) — picks up a newly-published year; see "Pre-OCDS backfill" |
| Daily watcher reports `АОП debarred-suppliers register: N entries` changed | Re-scrape the debarred list (`npx tsx scripts/procurement/debarred.ts`) — see Step 5 below |
| Daily watcher reports `ЦАИС ЕОП open data: N new publication day(s)` | Incremental EOP gap-fill (Step 1b) **and** tender-stage ingest (Step 1f) — both read the same storage.eop.bg buckets |
| User asks to "refresh procurement" / "ingest new contracts" | Same — incremental |
| `data/procurement/` empty (fresh clone) | Cold-start ingest of every visible bundle (~24 fortnights ≈ 1 year) |
| Canary mismatch warning surfaced | Investigate `scripts/procurement/normalize.ts` BEFORE re-running |
| Flagged >1B amount needs review | Inspect the row in the relevant `contracts/<YYYY>/<YYYY-MM>.json` — value may be a real megacontract or a source-side decimal-point error |

## Step 1 — Incremental ingest

```bash
npm run procurement:ingest-legacy -- --discover   # new annual-CSV years (usually a no-op)
npm run procurement:ingest                        # new OCDS fortnights + rebuild rollups
```

Run both, discovery first. `procurement:ingest` walks the АОП org's dataset listing on data.egov.bg, downloads any bundle whose `datasetUuid` is not already in `data/procurement/bundles.json`, normalizes its OCDS releases into `Contract` rows, and writes/merges month-shards. Then rebuilds per-EIK rollups under `contractors/` and `awarders/`.

`procurement:ingest-legacy -- --discover` exists because the OCDS ingester only consumes fortnight bundles — a newly-published *annual* CSV (e.g. when АОП posts the 2024 contracts dump) is skipped as "non-OCDS" and would otherwise sit uningested. Discovery walks the same listing, finds any `Договори и изменения на договори - YYYY` dataset whose year isn't in `LEGACY_DATASETS`, confirms its resource is a real `contracts*.csv` (not the out-of-scope `excl*` / `annexes*` dumps), and ingests it. On a normal day it finds nothing and exits in seconds; the `procurement:ingest` that follows rebuilds rollups + cross-reference over whatever it added.

Expected output on a normal day (one new fortnight published):

```
→ walking АОП dataset listing
  page 1: 6 bundle(s) collected
  7 bundle(s) listed
→ ingesting 1 bundle(s)
→ canary on bundle 1b347ef4-4384-4e6c-95cd-d9f850d2c545
  canary OK (sha256=… 1421 rows)
  • 2026-04-23…2026-05-06 (eed…)
    2380 release(s), emitted 1410 row(s) (c=980 a=1170 m=240, dropped 18)
→ wrote 1 new + 2 modified month-shard(s)
→ rebuilding contractor/awarder rollups
  4823 contractor file(s), 1102 awarder file(s)
→ building per-settlement procurement shards
  by_settlement/: 388 settlement file(s); 1460 local-tier buyer(s) pinned, 346 aggregated into _national.json, 1586 dropped (no cached address)
✓ index.json + bundles.json updated
```

The per-settlement step (added 2026) reads each awarder rollup's `geo` block (set by `buildRollups` via the resolver in `scripts/procurement/resolve_ekatte.ts`) and groups local-tier buyers by EKATTE. Output lives at `data/procurement/by_settlement/{ekatte}.json` + `index.json` + `_national.json` — drives the /procurement/by-settlement landing and the procurement tile on the existing settlement detail pages. Central ministries and national state companies are *not* pinned to settlements — they're aggregated into the national rollup. See [[project_procurement_geo]] for the methodology + the curated tier overrides in `scripts/procurement/awarder_tier.ts`.

**Notice type on the rollup rows:** since 2026 the slim `topContracts` rows in the contractor / awarder / by_settlement rollups carry the OCDS `tag` (`award` = announced/обявена, `contract` = awarded/възложена, `contractAmendment` = annex/анекс), and value-bearing `award` rows are no longer discarded. This lets the place dashboards and the My-Area alert feed (`scripts/myarea/build_alerts.ts`) label each contract announced / awarded / annex. No new ingest — a normal `procurement:ingest` rebuild populates it; finish with `bucket:sync:all` as usual.

**One-shot enrichment after this commit:** existing awarder rollups built before this code change have no `geo` block (the normalizer wasn't capturing locality/postalCode). Run `npx tsx scripts/procurement/enrich_awarders_geo.ts` once to backfill from the cached fortnight bundles in `raw_data/procurement/`. From the next `procurement:ingest` onward the rollup builder applies geo automatically.

**Curating the awarder_tier "other" bucket:** the enrichment writes `data/procurement/awarder_tier_unclassified.json` with every awarder whose name didn't match a tier heuristic. Skim it for entities that should be classified (e.g. new ministry sub-units), add an `OVERRIDES` entry in `scripts/procurement/awarder_tier.ts`, and re-run the enrichment (cheap — re-reads the same cached bundles).

If the canary line is missing it's because the canary bundle's `datasetUuid` matched the only-new-bundles filter and the run intentionally re-ran the canary as part of normal ingest. Either is fine.

## Step 1b — ЦАИС ЕОП gap-fill (storage.eop.bg)

АОП's OCDS "обявления" export (the data.egov.bg feed Step 1 ingests) is a strict **subset** of what ЦАИС ЕОП itself publishes. ЦАИС ЕОП's own daily open-data buckets (`storage.eop.bg/open-data-<YYYY-MM-DD>/`) carry a flat **`договори`** file that lists ~900 small contracting authorities — overwhelmingly schools & kindergartens — whose signed contracts never appear in the OCDS обявления export. The `eop_procurement` watcher source tracks that feed.

Run the incremental gap-fill, then rebuild (the rebuild is single-sourced in Step 1's `procurement:ingest`, which re-reads every month-shard including the new EOP rows):

```bash
npx tsx scripts/procurement/ingest_eop.ts --apply   # incremental: last ~30 days
npm run procurement:ingest                           # rebuild rollups/derived/by-settlement/index
```

`ingest_eop` fetches the flat `договори` feed and gap-fills **only buyers entirely absent from our corpus** — an absent buyer has zero OCDS rows, so an EOP row can never double-count an existing contract. New buyers get well-formed `Contract` rows (synthetic `eop-<УНП>` ids, namespaced away from OCDS) in the same month-shards, so the existing rollup machinery picks them up with no special handling. The flat feed carries no buyer address, so these awarders won't resolve to an EKATTE (absent from the by-settlement map, present everywhere else).

Caveats: the **incremental** gap-fill adds buyers we *lack* — it does not fill missing contracts of buyers we already have, because for any year the OCDS feed covers that would double-count the base. The one exception is years with **no** OCDS at all (2024/2025): there the `--include-existing-buyers` one-off (below) lifts that guard safely. It's the gap-fill, not a re-platform — the OCDS feed stays the base for every year it covers.

## Step 1c — Awarder geo-enrichment (place-view coverage)

The flat ЦАИС ЕОП feed carries no buyer address, so the gap-fill schools (and legacy-only buyers) have no `geo` → they're dropped from `by_settlement` and the my-area place tiles. Two map-builders harvest geo from the same storage.eop.bg buckets, then `scripts/procurement/awarder_geo_map.ts` combines all tiers into an EKATTE override map; `buildRollups` applies it **fill-missing** (an address-derived geo always wins). Run after new buyers land, then rebuild:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/procurement/build_ocds_party_geo.ts      # Tier E: OCDS обявления party addresses → settlement (storage.eop.bg, 2026+)
npx tsx scripts/procurement/build_tender_oblast_map.ts   # Tier D: поръчки executionPlaceNuts → buyer oblast (--backfill for full history)
npx tsx scripts/procurement/awarder_geo_map.ts           # combines tiers → data/procurement/awarder_geo_overrides.json
npm run procurement:ingest                                # rebuild applies the overrides to by_settlement
```

Tiers, in resolution order (see `docs/plans/procurement-awarder-geo-v2.md`):
- **Tier B — МОН school register** (data.egov.bg open-data resource `cac4d569-…`, via the egov `getResourceData` POST). Authoritative school/kindergarten EIK→settlement (~58% of the no-geo set). Degrades gracefully — when data.egov.bg blocks the host the script logs `Tier B skipped`; re-run from a reachable environment to land it.
- **Tier E — OCDS party addresses** (`build_ocds_party_geo.ts` → `derived/ocds_party_geo_map.json`). Harvests `parties[].address.locality`+NUTS from the OCDS обявления file by EIK across ALL parties → settlement. **High confidence; the biggest reachable lever — recovered ~1,232 buyers.** 2026+ only.
- **Tier D — tenders oblast** (`build_tender_oblast_map.ts` → `derived/buyer_oblast_map.json`). `executionPlaceNuts` modal oblast per buyer; not a settlement on its own — used to **disambiguate** the Tier-A name parse (`name+oblast`).
- **Tier A — name-suffix parse** ("- гр.X" / "- с.X" in the awarder name → resolver). Fully local; unique-match only.

Reachable tiers (A+D+E) resolve ~1,490 of the 3,533 no-geo buyers → `by_settlement` local-tier pinned 712 → 1,836. Tier B (МОН) adds the schools on top once reachable. The storage.eop.bg crawls cache to `raw_data/procurement/eop_ocds/` + `eop_tenders/`.

## Step 1d — Derived risk + feed indices (automatic)

`procurement:ingest` (Step 1) already emits these — no separate command. They power the risk index, the explorable pages, and the AI tool. Listed here so you know what changed and when to force a rebuild:

| File | Builder | Feeds |
|---|---|---|
| `derived/cpv_competition.json` | `cpv_competition.ts` | Per-2-digit-CPV single-bid baseline; gates the single-bidder risk flag (a division ≥80% single-bid is "structural" → flag suppressed) |
| `derived/pep_connected.json` + `derived/pep-by-eik/` (reverse, contractor→officials) + `derived/pep-by-slug/` (forward, official→contractors) | `pep_connected.ts` | Officials (non-MP: mayors / councillors / ministers / governors / agency heads) → contractor links, HIGH-confidence only. `pep-by-eik` surfaces on `/company/:eik` + adds the `pepConnected` risk component; `pep-by-slug` powers the procurement section on `/officials/:slug` + the official rows in the `/procurement/people` scanner. Each entry carries `byYear` + `topAwarders` (from the contractor rollup) so the official profile renders the same per-company history card as the MP procurement page |
| `derived/risk_feed.json` | `risk_feed.ts` | Slim top-50 concentration + top-50 MP-tied for `/procurement/flags` + the `procurementRedFlags` AI tool (so neither loads the ~1 MB `awarder_concentration.json`) |
| `derived/person_procurement_index.json` | `risk_feed.ts` | Slim per-person roster (MPs from `mp_connected.json` + officials from `pep_connected.json`, each row tagged `kind`) for the `/procurement/people` scanner |

Two dependencies to remember:
- **Single-bidder reads `release.bids.statistics[]`** (the OCDS field that's actually populated — `tender.numberOfTenderers` is ~0%). New fortnights pick it up automatically. To back-fill bid counts onto **already-ingested** rows after the parser changed, run the manual re-normalize (skips the diff-cap; cache-only, no network; never in CI per [[feedback_one_off_backfills]]):
  ```bash
  npm run procurement:ingest -- --renormalize   # re-process every cached bundle + full rebuild
  ```
- **`pep_connected` reads `data/officials/derived/company_links.json`** (produced by `/update-officials`). It only rebuilds when `procurement:ingest` runs, so after a `cacbg`/officials refresh changes that file, re-run `procurement:ingest` to refresh the officials→procurement links. Not gated on `companies-index.json` (uses the officials declarations tree).

## Step 1e — Sector / procedure / EU enrichment + breakdowns + contracts browser

The legacy CSV (2011–23) and the АОП OCDS export don't carry CPV / procedure / EU
fields uniformly — only the ЦАИС ЕОП flat feed does. Three offline, **map-safe**
passes (they write only per-contract fields + their own derived files; they never
touch rollups / `by_settlement` / the awarder geo) bring the corpus to SIGMA-level
field coverage. Run after Steps 1–1c (they read the on-disk shards):

```bash
npx tsx scripts/procurement/eop_field_map.ts --apply   # CPV/procedure/bids/euFunded onto contracts — content-join on (buyer,supplier,date) with a consortium value-date fallback. 2020–26 CPV 34%→98%
npx tsx scripts/procurement/eop_breakdowns.ts          # per-entity 'Какво купува'/'Как купува'+EU shards (derived/breakdowns/{c,a}/) + corpus derived/sector_totals.json
npx tsx scripts/procurement/contract_index.ts          # per-year slim shards (derived/contract_index/) for the faceted /procurement/contracts browser
npx tsx scripts/procurement/by_id_shards.ts            # prefix-sharded per-contract detail store (contracts/by-id/shard/) — full coverage for /procurement/contract/:key
```

Notes:
- `eop_field_map` is idempotent; `euFunded` is tri-state (known true/false vs unmatched). The EOP flat feed lacks some big legacy consortium contracts (e.g. АПИ roads), so the per-entity EU% is gated by value-coverage in the breakdown tile.
- Each `contract_index/<year>.json` is `{ awarders, contractors, rows }`: awarder/contractor names are dictionary-encoded (eik→name maps) and the compact row carries only the eik — the browser hook (`useContractBrowser.tsx`) rehydrates by reference so ~40k rows share a few thousand name strings (parse + memory win). The compact row is `[date, awarderEik, contractorEik, amountEur, cpvDivision, procedureBucket, euFunded, title, key, bidCount, cpv, euProgram]` — `key` deep-links each row to `/procurement/contract/:key`, `bidCount` (numberOfTenderers) lets the table compute the single-bidder red flag inline (the entity flags — debarred / MP-tied / official-tied / concentration — join by EIK/name from the risk-index files), `cpv` is the full 8-digit code (shown under the sector name; `cpvDivision` stays its 2-digit prefix for the sector facet), and `euProgram` is the operational-programme name shown in the EU-badge tooltip. All four are **appended** (positions 10–13) so a pre-bump shard still rehydrates; readers must treat them as optional. The "All years" facet (`?year=all`) merges every shard client-side (`useAllContractYears`, ~85 MB) for cross-year text search — opt-in, since it loads + risk-scores the whole corpus. `procedureBucket`/category labels resolve in the UI; English OCDS enums (`open`/`limited`/`selective`) are mapped to families in `cpvSectors.ts` (so the flat-feed years don't read as "Друга").
- `contracts/by-id/shard/<3-hex>.json` is a `{ key → Contract }` map (4096 shards, ~70 rows each) covering the **whole** corpus, so every browser row's detail link resolves. The sibling `contracts/by-id/<key>.json` single-file tree (top-N + MP-tied) is kept as the ~600-byte fast path; `useContract` tries the single file first and falls back to the shard. `writeByIdShards` runs automatically inside `ingest.ts`, `rebuild_derived.ts`, `dedup_legacy_twins.ts`, and `rebuild_from_cache.ts` (alongside `writeByIdContracts`); run it standalone after a manual `contract_index` rebuild. The shard tree is **gitignored** and reaches prod via `bucket:sync` (served uncompressed — ~100 KB/shard raw, not in the `bucket_gzip.ts` hot list).
- `derived/breakdowns/` + `derived/contract_index/` are **gitignored** (bulky — 12k + 15 shards); they reach prod via **`bucket:sync:all`** — the `contract_index` shards (5.7–14.5 MB raw), `concentration_full.json`, and (since 2026-06-22) the heavy per-EIK rollups `awarder_contracts/*` >50K, `contractors/*` >20K, `awarders/*` >20K (the `/company/:eik`, `/awarder/:eik` + `/company/:eik/contracts` payloads, ~6–10× on the wire) are gzip-shipped by `bucket_gzip.ts`, so a plain `bucket:sync` leaves them uncompressed. Only `derived/sector_totals.json` is committed. `bucket_gzip.ts` auto-discovers these dirs at runtime (size-thresholded `PER_EIK_DIRS`) — no per-EIK enumeration to maintain.

## Step 1f — Tender-stage ingest (procedures, not signed contracts)

The corpus above is **signed contracts**. The sibling **`поръчки`** file in the same `storage.eop.bg` daily buckets is the tender STAGE — the procedure before any contract: estimated (прогнозна) value, lots, status. `ingest_tenders.ts` writes a **parallel** `data/procurement/tenders/` tree that NEVER touches the contracted-spend rollups (estimated value is a forecast, kept in its own aggregate). Tracked by the **same `eop_procurement` watcher** (it fingerprints all three EOP files — договори + **поръчки** + OCDS), so a `ЦАИС ЕОП open data` change should refresh tenders too. Self-contained: it does **not** rebuild the contracts rollups, so run it independently of Step 1's `procurement:ingest`.

```bash
npx tsx scripts/procurement/ingest_tenders.ts --apply            # incremental: last ~30 days
npx tsx scripts/procurement/ingest_tenders.ts --apply --upload   # + bucket:sync the tenders tree
```

Output `data/procurement/tenders/`: `<YYYY>/<YYYY-MM>.json` month-shards + `by-tender/shard/` (per-procedure, keyed sha256(УНП)) + `by-ocid/shard/` (contract→tender lineage, keyed by the ocid's last 2 chars) + `by_year/<year>.json` (the slim search shards the FE `/procurement/tenders` search + the `openTenders` AI tool read) + `index.json`. All bulky shards are **gitignored** (see `.gitignore` — `tenders/{20*,by-tender,by-ocid,by_year}`); only the ~390 KB `index.json` is committed. They reach prod via `bucket:sync` (the `--upload` flag, or `bucket:sync:all`). Lineage to a signed contract is free: a contract's `ocid` = `ocds-e82gsb-<parentTenderId>`. See `docs/plans/procurement-tenders-ingest-v1.md`.

**Full 2020→ history is a one-off, flag-gated operator backfill — never in the watcher/CI** (it crawls ~2,300 daily `поръчки` buckets; raw days cache to `raw_data/procurement/eop_tenders/` so re-runs are offline):

```bash
npx tsx scripts/procurement/ingest_tenders.ts --from 2020-01-01 --to <today> --backfill --apply --upload
```

## Step 2 — Verify

```bash
node -e "
const idx = require('./data/procurement/index.json');
console.log('years:', idx.years.join(','), '| months:', idx.months.length);
console.log('totals:', idx.totals);
console.log('latest period:', idx.periods[0]);
"
```

You should see:
- `years:` listing every year with contract data on disk.
- `totals.contracts` + `totals.amendments` reflect everything ingested.
- `totals.byCurrency` shows BGN + EUR (Bulgaria's eurozone transition mixes both — do not coerce).

Check the diff:

```bash
git diff --stat data/procurement/
```

Expected: 1-2 month-shards modified or added, plus `index.json` + `bundles.json` + N changed `contractors/*.json` + N changed `awarders/*.json`. The diff-cap aborts the run if >5% of the existing tree touched.

## Step 3 — Upload to bucket

```bash
npm run procurement:ingest -- --upload
```

Or upload separately:

```bash
gsutil -m -h "Cache-Control:no-cache, max-age=0" rsync -r -J \
  data/procurement/ gs://data-electionsbg-com/procurement/
```

## Step 4 — Commit

```bash
git add data/procurement/ tests/fixtures/procurement/
git commit -m "procurement: ingest fortnight YYYY-MM-DD…YYYY-MM-DD"
```

The canary fixture is committed.

## Step 5 — Refresh АОП debarred-suppliers list (optional, gated on watcher)

The "Регистър на стопанските субекти с нарушения" on www2.aop.bg is a tiny upstream — typically 1-5 active entries — that AOП publishes when a КЗК ruling becomes final. The processed JSON is at `data/procurement/debarred.json` and drives the "В черен списък" red-flag chip on contract tables.

Run this step ONLY when the daily watcher reports the `aop_debarred` source as changed, or when explicitly asked to refresh the debarred list:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/procurement/debarred.ts
```

Expected output on a normal run:

```
→ fetching https://www2.aop.bg/stopanski-subekti/stopanski-subekti-s-narusheniya/
  parsed 2 row(s)
  0 new row(s); 2 total in snapshot (includes 0 historical entries no longer on the live page)
  wrote data/procurement/debarred.json
```

The scraper is merge-on-write: it preserves historical entries even after the upstream page purges them (the срок field expires automatically), so the file accumulates rather than overwrites. Commit alongside the procurement ingest:

```bash
git add data/procurement/debarred.json
git commit -m "procurement: refresh АОП debarred-suppliers list"
```

If the watcher flips and the scraper writes no changes (typical when the page is recompiled but the row set is the same), skip the commit. Use `git diff data/procurement/debarred.json` to verify.

## Backfill

To backfill prior OCDS periods (e.g. on first ingest), pass `--since` for a cutoff:

```bash
# Backfill everything published since the start of 2026 (when OCDS publishing began)
npm run procurement:ingest -- --since 2020-01-01

# Limit to N most recent bundles in one run (avoids long single runs)
npm run procurement:ingest -- --max-bundles 5
```

The walker emits oldest-first within the new-bundle filter so partial runs progress through history rather than re-fetching the same window.

### Pre-OCDS backfill (annual CSVs)

АОП only started publishing OCDS-standard fortnight bundles on 2026-01-01. Earlier years are published as annual CSV dumps (with shifting schemas). The `procurement:ingest-legacy` script handles these:

```bash
# Auto-discover + ingest any annual-CSV year not in LEGACY_DATASETS
npm run procurement:ingest-legacy -- --discover

# Ingest all known legacy years (2011-2015 bundled, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020,
# 2021, 2022 CE+RL, 2023 CE+RL)
npm run procurement:ingest-legacy

# Or one year at a time (the РОП variant uses a "-RL" token)
npm run procurement:ingest-legacy -- --year 2023
npm run procurement:ingest-legacy -- --year 2023-RL

# Dry-run (parse + validate but don't write)
npm run procurement:ingest-legacy -- --year 2023 --dry-run
```

The legacy ingester:
- Resolves CSRF-protected download via the data.egov.bg form flow (GET resource page → POST `/resource/download` with `_token` + cookie).
- Caches the raw CSV under `raw_data/procurement/legacy/<year>.csv.gz`.
- Maps columns by name pattern (defensive against schema drift across years).
- Writes Contract rows into the same `data/procurement/contracts/<YYYY>/<YYYY-MM>.json` month-shards used by the OCDS ingest.
- Does NOT rebuild rollups + cross-reference + by-id files itself — run `npm run procurement:ingest -- --since 2020-01-01` afterward to refresh derived state from the expanded corpus.

`--discover` walks the listing and ingests any `Договори и изменения на договори - YYYY` dataset whose year isn't already in `LEGACY_DATASETS`, after confirming via the detail page that its resource is a `contracts*.csv` (the 2018 dataset is titled like an annual dump but actually carries the out-of-scope `excl2018.csv` — discovery rejects it). It's idempotent: a discovered year that hasn't been pinned into `LEGACY_DATASETS` is simply re-discovered and re-merged (no double-count) on the next run. Optionally pin a confirmed new year's UUID into `LEGACY_DATASETS` afterward.

2018 contracts are not published by АОП (only the out-of-scope file `excl2018.csv` exists). For 2024 and 2025 АОП publishes **only a РОП (RL) annual CSV** — no ЦАИС ЕОП (CE) file and no OCDS bundle (OCDS fortnight bundles start 2026-01-01). Crucially these RL dumps are a **tiny old-register tail, not a full-year corpus**: `contracts2024_RL` ≈ 136 rows / €37.6M, `contracts2025_RL` ≈ 50 rows / €23.4M (mostly sectoral/utility buyers like АЕЦ Козлодуй still filing in РОП). The full ЦАИС-era 2024/2025 corpus is gap-filled from the ЦАИС ЕОП flat feed via the `--include-existing-buyers` one-off (below) — that fill is **vastly more complete**, so:

- **Do NOT drop the `eop-` 2024/2025 shards** to swap in the RL dumps — that would discard the full year for a ~136-row tail. (The earlier "drop the eop- shards first" note assumed the RL file would be a full CE-style corpus; it isn't.)
- The RL dumps are at most an **additive supplement** in their own `2024-RL`/`2025-RL` namespace (the same role the 2022-RL/2023-RL files play next to their CE files). РОП vs ЦАИС ЕОП are near-disjoint by construction, and at €37.6M/€23.4M even full overlap is <0.1% of the corpus — but the eop↔RL overlap is unmeasured, so spot-check before pinning them in. `--discover` finds both (UUIDs `88ea1672…` for 2024-RL, `7990cb41…` for 2025-RL) but is operator-run, never the watcher, so ingesting them stays a deliberate choice.

Download-flow note: data.egov.bg's per-resource `/resource/download` endpoint broke server-side around June 2026 (it 302-redirects to the portal HTML shell with a "Грешка при вземане на метаданни за ресурс" flash for **every** file resource — not a CSRF/session issue we can satisfy from the client). `fetchLegacyCsv` now routes through the dataset-level **bulk-zip** export (`/dataset/{uuid}/resources/download/{fmt}` → zip), which is a separate, still-working endpoint; no action needed unless that one breaks too.

### ЦАИС ЕОП full-history gap-fill (one-off)

To capture the ~900 small authorities the OCDS feed omits across the full 2020→ history (not just the rolling incremental window of Step 1b), run the backfill once. It crawls ~1,600 daily flat-`договори` buckets (network-heavy, ~30-60 min; raw days cache to `raw_data/procurement/eop/` so re-runs are fast) and is **flag-gated and operator-run — never in the watcher or CI**:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/procurement/ingest_eop.ts --from 2020-01-01 --to <today> --backfill --apply
npm run procurement:ingest      # rebuild rollups/derived/by-settlement/index from the new shards
```

### 2024/2025 coverage — ЦАИС ЕОП for buyers we already have (one-off)

АОП has no OCDS bundle or annual CSV for 2024/2025, but the ЦАИС ЕОП flat `договори` feed carries both years in full. Step 1b's gap-fill drops those rows because their buyers already exist in our corpus (from other years) — yet with **no OCDS for 2024/2025 there is nothing to double-count**, so the absent-buyer guard is wrong for exactly that window. `--include-existing-buyers` lifts it for a bounded range; all 731 days are already cached, so this runs offline:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/procurement/ingest_eop.ts --from 2024-01-01 --to 2025-12-31 \
  --backfill --include-existing-buyers --apply       # ~82k rows from raw_data/procurement/eop/
npx tsx scripts/procurement/rebuild_from_cache.ts     # offline rebuild — use THIS, not procurement:ingest, while data.egov.bg IP-blocks us
```

**Only ever pass `--include-existing-buyers` for OCDS-gap years.** For 2020–2023 or 2026 it would double-count the whole corpus against the OCDS base.

**Multi-supplier value split.** The flat feed — like the OCDS export — repeats one award's *full* value on every supplier row of a consortium / parallel framework. `normalize.ts` + `normalize_eop.ts` split that value across the suppliers (`amount / N`) so the rows sum back to the award total. Without it, 2024/2025's drug-procurement mega-frameworks alone inflated the corpus headline to €120.6bn (vs €80.0bn split; the 2020–2026 window then matches SIGMA's €51.7bn). Changing that logic needs a full re-normalize — `rebuild_from_cache` reads the already-split shards and won't recompute it.

## Single bundle (debugging)

```bash
# Re-ingest one specific dataset
npm run procurement:ingest -- --bundle 3edde0c3-80da-468c-8536-53db74680863

# Force a re-fetch even if the bundle is in the local cache
npm run procurement:ingest -- --bundle <UUID> --refresh-cache
```

The local cache lives under `raw_data/procurement/<resourceUuid>.json.gz` (gitignored — alongside `raw_data/tr/`).

## Data-integrity contract

This skill fails loud rather than write partial / corrupt data. Surfaces that halt before any write:

| Surface | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP error on data.egov.bg | non-200 on dataset listing or bundle download | Throws |
| Dataset page period label missing | Bundle's "...периода от DD-MM-YYYY до DD-MM-YYYY..." regex didn't match | Throws naming the dataset UUID |
| Negative amount on a contract | Source data error | Throws naming the release id |
| Canary mismatch | Pinned bundle (1b347ef4-…) produces bytes different from the committed fixture | Throws |
| Diff-cap exceeded | Run would touch > 5% of existing month-shards | Throws |

Surfaces that are **intentionally non-fatal**:

| Surface | Behaviour | Why not a hard fail |
|---|---|---|
| Release tag not in {award, contract, contractAmendment} | Skipped silently | Pure tender notices have no contractor + no money — nothing for us to record |
| Buyer EIK missing on a release | Counted in `releasesSkippedNoBuyer` | Rare; usually placeholder rows from system tests |
| Supplier EIK missing on a row | Counted in `rowsDroppedNoSupplierEik` | Cannot be cross-referenced against MP-companies anyway |
| Amount ≥ 1B (BGN or EUR) | Printed as "review manually" but ingested | Could be a real mega-contract OR a decimal-point error; both warrant a human glance, not an auto-block |

## Common pitfalls

### Canary mismatch
The canary bundle is re-normalized at the start of every run. If the output bytes drift from the committed fixture, the parser regressed. Steps:

1. Re-fetch + decompress the cached bundle:
   ```bash
   gunzip -c raw_data/procurement/1b347ef4-4384-4e6c-95cd-d9f850d2c545.json.gz | head -c 5000
   ```
2. Compare to what the normalizer produced — look for changes in the OCDS extension set or new tag values.
3. Update `scripts/procurement/normalize.ts` if the format genuinely changed.
4. Re-seed the fixture:
   ```bash
   rm tests/fixtures/procurement/canary.json
   npm run procurement:ingest -- --bundle 3edde0c3-80da-468c-8536-53db74680863 --skip-canary
   ```
5. Re-run `npm run procurement:ingest` — the canary will be re-seeded on the next run that includes the pinned bundle, or seeded fresh by deleting the fixture file.

### "could not parse period from label"
data.egov.bg occasionally publishes a bundle whose label doesn't follow the standard "периода от DD-MM-YYYY до DD-MM-YYYY" phrasing. The walker throws naming the offending UUID. Options:
1. Inspect the dataset page (https://data.egov.bg/data/view/<UUID>) — confirm what period it covers.
2. Skip that bundle with `--bundle <other-UUID>` for now and report the anomaly upstream.

### Currency mismatch in totals
On `data/procurement/index.json`, `totals.byCurrency` may show both BGN and EUR. This is correct — Bulgaria joined the eurozone on 2026-01-01 and the rollover spans the bundle data. Do NOT coerce; the SPA displays both.

### EIK length oddities
Most BG EIKs are 9 digits (parent legal entity). 13-digit EIKs are branch / clone forms and get canonicalized to 9 (the first 9 chars) in `Contract.contractorEik`, with the full 13-digit form preserved in `contractorEikFull` for source-link continuity. 10-digit EIKs (rare older BULSTAT) are kept as-is — the cross-reference against `companies-index.json` will miss them, which is the expected behaviour.

## Cross-reference output (Phase 2)

The ingest always runs the officials cross-reference (`pep_connected.json`, from the officials declarations tree); when `data/parliament/companies-index.json` is also present it runs the MP cross-reference too. Together they write these derived files:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `data/procurement/derived/mp_connected.json` | One entry per (mpId, contractor) pair: relations (TR roles + declared stakes), total awarded, top awarders, byYear. The journalism payload. |
| `data/procurement/derived/pep_connected.json` (+ `pep-by-eik/`, `pep-by-slug/` shards) | One entry per (official, contractor) pair — the **non-MP** political class (cabinet, deputy ministers, agency heads, governors, mayors, deputy-mayors, council chairs, councillors, chief architects). HIGH-confidence links only. |
| `data/procurement/derived/top_contractors.json` | Top-1000 contractors corpus-wide, each flagged `mpTied: boolean`. Powers the `/procurement` index page. |
| `data/procurement/derived/contractors_search.json` | Slim `{eik,name}` index of **all** ~26k contractors (not just the top-1000), value-ranked. Powers the `/procurement` dashboard's company-name search box (lazy-loaded on first focus) and the chat `contractSearch` long-tail resolver. Emitted by `writeDerived` via `build_contractors_search.ts`. Add it to `bucket_gzip.ts`'s hot-file list (done) so it ships gzipped. |
| `data/procurement/derived/flow.json` | Sankey-shaped money flow (awarder → contractor → **MP or official**), trimmed to the top ~150 links by value — the eager preview the `/procurement` landing tile loads. |
| `data/procurement/derived/flow_full.json` | The complete flow graph (all MP- and official-tied links), lazy-loaded only by the `/procurement/flows` explorer. |

Per-election `by_ns/<election>.json` files also gain officials totals (`officialCount`, `officialConnected*`, de-duplicated `connected*`) and a `topOfficials[]` ranking alongside the existing `topMps[]`. `buildByNs` additionally emits five per-election sidecars from the same date-filtered walk, each the date-scoped sibling of a corpus derived file — so every `/procurement` section page honours the `?pscope` scope toggle (default `ns`, the selected parliament's contract window):

- `by_ns/flow/<election>.json` — date-scoped sankey (awarder → connected company → person), sibling of `derived/flow_full.json`.
- `by_ns/people/<election>.json` — the "public money scanner" index, sibling of `derived/person_procurement_index.json`.
- `by_ns/concentration/<election>.json` — single-supplier concentration table (≥30% of in-range spend, buyer ≥ €100k), sibling of `derived/concentration_full.json`.
- `by_ns/risk_feed/<election>.json` — red-flag feed (top concentration + MP-tied + counts + per-oblast tally), sibling of `derived/risk_feed.json`. (Debarred suppliers stay corpus — a "currently barred" register has no date dimension.)
- `by_ns/by_settlement/<election>.json` — the "procurement by settlement" landing index (local-tier buyers pinned to their seat EKATTE via the awarder-rollup geo join + national rollup), sibling of `by_settlement/index.json`. Only the index is sliced; the per-EKATTE detail drill-down has no scope toggle and stays corpus.

`bucket_gzip.ts` ships all five subdirs.

The cross-reference reads `companies[].tr.uic` as the join key. The skill **hard-fails** if `companies-index.json` is present but TR enrichment is missing on >90% of entries — that's the silent "TR refresh wasn't run" failure mode where mp_connected.json would otherwise collapse to empty.

**TR-namesake filter (name-collision guard).** `cross_reference.ts` only keeps an MP↔company link when the relation is a declared stake OR the MP's name maps to a **single** TR company (`buildTrNamesakeCounts(raw_data/tr/state.sqlite)`, the same bar `/update-connections` applies). This drops name-only matches against big state firms (e.g. an MP namesake "directing" Автомагистрали / Български пощи / НЕК) — the inflation that took the headline from 38 MPs / €533M up to a false 55 / €711M. The filter degrades gracefully (keeps all matches, logs a warning) when the TR SQLite is absent, but in that case `companies-index.json`'s `mpRoles` must already be clean — i.e. `/update-connections` ran post-fix. So keep the ordering invariant below. `pep_connected` (officials) is already filtered upstream in `company_links.json` (HIGH-only).

**Offline rebuild.** When data.egov.bg is IP-blocked (the АОП org listing 403s) but the link tables changed, `npx tsx scripts/procurement/rebuild_derived.ts` regenerates every link-dependent derived artifact (pep/mp connected + shards, top_contractors, flow + flow_full, by_ns, by-id, risk_feed, concentration_full, person_procurement_index) from disk — no network, no contract re-parse. It mirrors the no-new-bundles branch of `ingest.ts`. Pass **`--reuse-mp`** to load the existing `mp_connected.json` instead of recomputing it from `companies-index.json` + the TR-namesake filter — use this when only the **officials** side changed, so the published MP figures stay byte-stable (the namesake filter is sensitive to the exact TR snapshot on disk and can otherwise shift the MP headline by a pair or two). With `--reuse-mp` the `index.json` `crossReference` is left untouched; `officialsCrossReference` is still refreshed.

**Legacy "-x" twin guard (de-dup).** An early legacy-CSV ingest emitted blank-document-id rows that took the `documentId || "x"` ocid fallback in `legacy_csv.ts` (e.g. `aop-legacy-2019-x`); a later run re-ingested the same contracts with their real document number, and because `writeMonthShards` merges on `key` (which embeds the document id) the two never collapsed — ~34,091 duplicate pairs across 2016/2017/2019/2021 that double-counted ~€11bn. `dropSyntheticLegacyTwins` (`validate.ts`) drops the `-x` member of any pair sharing (date, awarderEik, contractorEik, amount, title) with a real twin; it is wired into **both** `writeMonthShards` paths (`ingest.ts` + `ingest_legacy.ts`), so every future ingest self-heals — no watcher/process-watch-report change needed. The corpus was cleaned once via `npx tsx scripts/procurement/dedup_legacy_twins.ts` (phase 1 strips `-x` from all shards; phase 2 full offline rebuild — same steps as `ingest.ts` minus the network walk; `--dry-run` to report, `--recompute-mp` to rebuild the MP roster instead of the default reuse-and-refresh). Unlike `rebuild_derived.ts --reuse-mp`, this runner's reuse mode **does** refresh the MP `crossReference` euro totals (contracts changed, so the inflated totals must drop) while keeping the namesake roster byte-stable. This was a one-time cleanup — the guard makes a re-run unnecessary.

If `companies-index.json` is missing entirely, the procurement ingest still completes (raw contracts + rollups land on disk); the cross-reference step logs a skip with a hint to run /update-connections.

**Ordering dependency.** When the orchestrator queues both `/update-connections` and `/update-procurement` from a single watch report, `/update-connections` must run first — it produces `companies-index.json`, which the cross-reference reads. The watcher source list in `scripts/watch/sources/index.ts` already places `cacbgDeclarations` and `egovCommerce` (both → update-connections) before `egovProcurement`, so the natural source-order traversal handles this without explicit dependency declaration. If you reorder the SOURCES list, preserve this invariant.

The `crossReference` field on `data/procurement/index.json` is the at-a-glance MP summary: `{ mpCount, contractorCount, pairCount, byCurrency }`. A sibling `officialsCrossReference` (`{ officialCount, contractorCount, pairCount, totalEur }`, de-duplicated by contractor EIK) carries the same for the non-MP officials; both power the `/procurement` "Свързани лица / Connected people" headline card and the AI `procurementTotals` tool.

## What this skill does NOT do

- **Does not write frontend UI.** Phase 3+ of the PRD (per-MP tile, /procurement page, /company/:eik page) consume the data via React Query hooks once it's on the bucket.
- **Does not auto-fire.** The watcher reports new bundles; the orchestrator or the user decides when to run.
- **Does not run /update-connections.** The orchestrator runs it separately when declarations or Commerce Registry change. If a fresh clone runs /update-procurement without /update-connections having run first, the cross-reference step logs a skip and the journalism payload is empty until /update-connections produces companies-index.json.
