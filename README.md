# electionsbg.com

A platform for visualizing and analyzing Bulgarian parliamentary elections, parliament composition, MP business interests, polling accuracy, and campaign financing — covering elections from 2005 to today. Live at [electionsbg.com](https://electionsbg.com).

## What's in here

The app started as election results visualization and has grown to cover the broader political picture. The current feature surface:

- **Elections** — results and turnout from settlement up to national level for every parliamentary election since 2005, plus drill-down to the ~13,000 polling sections and side-by-side comparison across cycles.
- **Anomaly reports** — concentration, turnout outliers, top gainers/losers, invalid ballots, recount-flagged sections, voting-machine flash-memory corrections (SUEMG), risk neighborhoods.
- **Election integrity & risk analysis** (`/risk-analysis`) — a composite Election Risk Index per cycle; a per-section 0–100 risk-screening score from seven independent signals (recount delta, flash-memory mismatch, invalid ballots, day-of additions, vote concentration, peer-section outlier, and cross-election swing vs. the same section last cycle); per-party Benford 2BL tests; and a geographic risk-cluster map that groups physically adjacent same-party elevated-risk sections — the spatial fingerprint of a controlled / corporate vote.
- **Parties** — per-party regional/municipal/settlement performance, candidate preferences, vote-flow timelines, head-to-head comparisons, AI-generated campaign retrospects.
- **Candidates** — profile pages with regional results, preference votes, donations, declared assets, and business connections.
- **Parliament** — current and past MPs with bios, photos, declared assets, vehicles, and a graph of their business connections (companies they own or manage, plus shared officers and addresses). Each MP profile opens with a four-metric scorecard (party loyalty, attendance, declared net worth, contracts to connected firms) carrying a parliament-wide rank or median for context.
- **Public officials** — non-MP property and interest declarations for the executive branch (cabinet members, deputy ministers, state and executive agency heads, regional governors). Sourced from the same Court of Audit register that covers MPs (`register.cacbg.bg`). Sortable ranking at `/officials/assets` with filter chips per role, and a per-official profile page with assets summary, year-over-year delta, and the full declarations timeline. Mayors and judiciary live in the same upstream but are out of scope.
- **Governments** — coalition compositions and ministerial line-ups by parliamentary term.
- **Polls** — pre-election polls scraped from Wikipedia, accuracy metrics per agency, and editorial narratives.
- **Demographics** — Census 2021 overlays (age, education, ethnicity) at country/region/municipality level; annual sub-national indicators per municipality (registered unemployment, state-matura DZI scores, NSI population change, plus **natural population change** and **net migration** from NSI vital statistics) with year-over-year deltas and choropleths; an oblast layer (Eurostat GDP/population/migration plus **long-term-unemployment share** from Агенция по заетостта); quarterly **ГРАО settlement-level registered population** (permanent + current address) surfaced on settlement pages; and a municipality-grain **vote ↔ demographics correlation** — a cross-tab scatter and per-party "demographic fingerprint" computed across all 265 municipalities.
- **Campaign financing** — donors, income, expenses, donor leaderboards, parsed from the Court of Audit's Smetna Palata register. Plus a year-by-year **annual-report filing-status catalogue** (`/financing/annual-reports`): which parties filed their statutory annual financial report on time, late, with deficiencies, or not at all — 2011 onward, scraped from the Court of Audit's gfopp register.
- **Public procurement** — fortnightly OCDS contract bundles from the АОП (Агенция за обществени поръчки) feed on data.egov.bg, aggregated per contractor / awarding body / month, with an MP cross-reference layer that surfaces awards going to companies owned or managed by sitting MPs. Each contract row carries a 0–100 risk score combining four signals: contractor is on the АОП "Стопански субекти с нарушения" debarred-suppliers register, contractor is MP-tied, awarder concentration on this contractor ≥30% of its lifetime spending, and post-award amendment. Sortable column + chip tooltips per signal.
- **EU funds** — the ИСУН 2020 public beneficiary register (`2020.eufunds.bg`): ~53,000 organisations that have signed an EU-funds contract under the 2014-2020, 2021-2027 and Recovery-Plan programmes, with funds contracted and funds actually paid, aggregated by organisation type and by public-/private-law form (most of the money flows through state bodies, not private firms). Ingested into `data/funds/`, with an MP cross-reference layer (`derived/mp_connected.json`) that surfaces EU-funds beneficiaries owned or managed by sitting MPs — the same EIK-keyed join the procurement feature uses. No dedicated screen yet.
- **State budget** — consolidated execution time series from the data.egov.bg КФП feed, per-ministry appropriations parsed from the State Budget Law (Държавен вестник HTML), and per-ministry "Отчет за изпълнението на програмния бюджет" reports reconciled at admin + program grain (law → amended → executed). Cross-linked to procurement so each spending unit's awards show on its ministry page.
- **Macro & governance indicators** — `/indicators` cabinet-aligned timeline of GDP, HICP, fiscal balances (both as % of GDP and in nominal EUR — debt level, quarterly issuance Δ, deficit, current account, FDI, government revenue/expenditure), the **fiscal reserve** (фискален резерв — end-of-quarter stock with the statutory floor drawn as a reference line), EU funds, Eurobarometer trust, Worldwide Governance Indicators, Transparency CPI, and household-level series (poverty, Gini, youth unemployment, house-price YoY). Also: a sortable table of every Bulgarian sovereign debt emission — international Eurobonds (curated, since 2002) and domestic ДЦК auctioned by the BNB (scraped, 2019+) with ISIN, coupon %, settlement yield, term and maturity.
- **Vote flows** — transition matrices estimating where each party's votes moved between consecutive elections.
- **Articles** — long-form editorials and methodology notes (plain markdown, BG + EN).

A simulator at `/simulator` lets you redistribute votes and see the resulting seat allocation under Bulgaria's electoral formula.

## Tech stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript** (strict), **Vite 6** with SWC
- **React Router v7** with every screen lazy-loaded
- **TanStack React Query v5** for all data fetching (`staleTime: Infinity`, no refetch on focus)
- **Tailwind CSS** + CSS Modules; **Radix UI** primitives with shadcn-style wrappers in `src/components/ui/`
- **Recharts** for charts, **D3** for Sankey/vote-flow diagrams, **Leaflet** for maps (CSS dynamically loaded so it stays off the landing critical path)
- **TanStack Table** for the data grids
- **react-markdown** for the long-form articles (plain `.md` with YAML frontmatter, not MDX)
- **i18next** with English and Bulgarian, preference stored in `localStorage`
- **Self-hosted Inter + Fraunces** under `/public/fonts/` (refreshed via `node scripts/fonts/fetch-fonts.mjs`)
- **Playwright** for E2E, SEO, performance, and responsive smoke tests
- **Firebase Hosting** for the SPA shell (rewrites in `firebase.json`)
- **Google Cloud Storage** (`gs://data-electionsbg-com`) for the data layer — fetched at runtime via the `dataUrl()` helper so data updates don't require a Firebase deploy
- **GitHub Actions** for the daily upstream watcher + ingest jobs (see `.github/workflows/`)

`@/*` is a tsconfig path alias for `src/*`.

## Local development

The generated election data under `data/2*/`, `data/sections/`, `data/settlements/`, `data/municipalities/`, and `data/regions/` is **not committed to git** — it is reproduced from `raw_data/` by the pipeline. After cloning:

```bash
npm install
npm run prod      # regenerate data/ from raw_data/ (a few minutes)
npm run dev       # start the Vite dev server
```

The Vite dev server includes a `serveDataDir` plugin (see `vite.config.ts`) that mounts `/data/` at the root of the dev server, so `fetch("/2026_04_19/national_summary.json")` resolves to `data/2026_04_19/national_summary.json` locally without needing the bucket.

In production the same fetch resolves to `https://storage.googleapis.com/data-electionsbg-com/2026_04_19/national_summary.json` because `VITE_DATA_BASE_URL` is set in `.env.production`. The `dataUrl()` helper in `src/data/` is the single seam — every data fetch goes through it.

## Data flow

1. Raw inputs live in `raw_data/` — CIK CSV/ZIP exports per election, NSI Census XLSX, scraped Wikipedia/Smetna-Palata/parliament.bg/Court-of-Audit data.
2. The pipeline in `scripts/` transforms those into static JSON under `data/YYYY_MM_DD/` (per election) and a handful of cross-cutting directories (`data/parliament/`, `data/polls/`, `data/census/`, `data/governments.json`, etc.).
3. The SPA fetches those JSON files via the `dataUrl()` helper, which prefixes the bucket origin in production. There is no backend server, no database, and no runtime API.

### Architecture: Firebase shell + GCS data layer

The site is split across two origins to decouple data updates from app deploys:

- **Firebase Hosting** (`electionsbg.com`) serves the SPA shell: prerendered HTML, JS bundle, fonts, OG cards, sitemaps, articles markdown, favicons. Anything in `/public/` ships here. SPA rewrites and per-route prerendering live in `firebase.json`.
- **GCS bucket** (`gs://data-electionsbg-com`) serves the data layer: per-election JSON, parliament/, polls/, census/, declarations/. Anything in `/data/` syncs here via `npm run bucket:sync`.

A scraper writing fresh polls or roll-call data only needs `npm run bucket:sync` — no Firebase deploy. App code changes still need a deploy because the prerendered HTML (~445k files) ships through Firebase. Both bucket and Firebase are gzipped; the bucket has CORS open to all SPA origins.

### Data layout

Files and directories the SPA fetches at runtime — all under `/data/` locally and `gs://data-electionsbg-com/` in production:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `YYYY_MM_DD/` | Per-election results, reports, party assessments, candidate data, financing |
| `parliament/` | MP index, profiles, declarations, business-connections graph, companies index, cached MP photos (.webp), roll-call sessions + derived metrics |
| `officials/` | Non-MP property/interest declarations from the same Court-of-Audit register: per-slug declarations under `declarations/<slug>.json`, plus `index.json` (role + institution) and `assets-rankings.json` (net worth + YoY delta, with `byCategory` slices for cabinet / agency heads / regional governors) |
| `polls/` | Polls, agencies, accuracy metrics, narrative analyses |
| `census/` | Per-region and per-municipality Census 2021 slices |
| `regions/` `municipalities/` `settlements/` `sections/` | Geography-keyed per-location detail (gitignored — regenerated by `npm run prod`) |
| `transitions/` | Vote-flow transition matrices between consecutive elections |
| `maps/` | Per-region/municipality GeoJSON slices |
| `canonical_parties.json` | Master party register (name variants, history, colors) |
| `governments.json` | Government coalitions and ministers by parliamentary term |
| `parliament_groups.json` | Parliamentary group (faction) memberships |
| `macro.json` | Macroeconomic + governance indicators for the cabinet timeline (Eurostat GDP/HICP/unemployment, fiscal triple as % of GDP + nominal EUR, FDI inward, government revenue/expenditure, World Bank WGI, Transparency International CPI, Eurobarometer trust, EU funds, plus the **fiscal-reserve** end-of-quarter stock series derived from minfin.bg monthly bulletins) |
| `cofog.json` | General-government expenditure by COFOG-99 function from Eurostat `gov_10a_exp` (S13, annual, MIO_NAC converted at the 1.95583 BGN/EUR parity). Top-level functions GF01..GF10 + TOTAL, plus a per-function 27-member EU peer band (BG rank + EU27 average). Drives the **functional-classification** tile, the **"what did your taxes buy"** calculator, and the per-function peer chips on `/budget` |
| `macro_peers.json` | Eurostat `gov_10a_main` (S13, annual, % of GDP). Carries two cuts: a 5-country series (BG, EU27, RO, HU, PL) for the multi-year sparklines on the `/governance` peer-comparison tile, and a 27-member EU peer band (BG rank + EU27 average) per naItem for the `/budget` headline-card peer chips |
| `debt-emissions.json` + `debt-emissions-domestic.json` | Sovereign debt emissions list. International Eurobonds since 2002 are hand-curated (`debt-emissions.json`); domestic ДЦК auctions 2019+ are scraped from BNB Fiscal Agent pages (`debt-emissions-domestic.json`). Merged client-side on `/indicators` into one sortable table |
| `regional.json` | Per-oblast indicators — Eurostat NUTS 3 (GDP per capita, population, net migration) plus long-term-unemployment share merged from Агенция по заетостта — drives the oblast drilldown tile and the `/demographics` regional choropleth |
| `indicators.json` | Per-municipality annual indicators (registered unemployment from Агенция по заетостта, DZI matura scores from МОН via data.egov.bg, natural population change + net migration from НСИ vital statistics) — drives the municipality drilldown tile and the muni-granularity `/demographics` choropleth, with Sofia city aggregate fallback for the 24 districts. Per-municipality slices under `indicators/<code>.json` for the tile |
| `grao_population.json` + `grao/<obshtina>.json` | ГРАО settlement-level registered population (permanent + current address), refreshed quarterly. Full bundle plus per-municipality ~1 KB slices — settlement pages fetch only their own slice |
| `YYYY_MM_DD/dashboard/demographic_scatter.json` | Per-municipality vote totals for the `/demographics` vote↔demographics scatter (joined client-side to the census municipalities) |
| `procurement/` | Public-procurement contracts from АОП via data.egov.bg: per-month `Contract[]` shards under `contracts/<YYYY>/<YYYY-MM>.json`, per-contractor and per-awarder rollups, an MP cross-reference (`derived/mp_connected.json`, `derived/top_contractors.json`, `derived/flow.json`, `derived/awarder_concentration.json`), the АОП debarred-suppliers register snapshot (`debarred.json`, merge-on-write so historical entries persist after the upstream purges them), plus `index.json` + `bundles.json` |
| `funds/` | EU-funds beneficiary register from ИСУН 2020 (`2020.eufunds.bg`): `index.json` (corpus totals, by-organisation-type and by-public/private-law breakdowns, top beneficiaries, MP `crossReference` summary), `beneficiaries/<0-9>.json` + `_x.json` shards keyed on EIK last digit — one row per organisation with contracts signed, funds contracted and funds actually paid, all EUR — and `derived/mp_connected.json`, the MP cross-reference (beneficiaries tied to sitting MPs by a declared stake or management role) |
| `budget/` | State-budget data: `kfp.json` (consolidated execution time series + monthly snapshots from data.egov.bg КФП), `facts/` (per-ministry BudgetFacts at law/amendment/execution stage, admin + program grain), `classification/` (administrative + program registries), `reconciliation/` (law → amended → executed roll-up), `ministries/` (per-spending-unit slices the ministry screen reads one file from), `derived/` (admin-flow Sankey, plan-vs-actual variance), `documents.json` (law + amendment + execution document index), `crosswalk-overrides.json`, `index.json` |
| `financing/` | Court of Audit party-financing artifacts: `index.json` (annual-report year catalogue scraped from bulnao.government.bg), and `reports.json` + `reports-summary.json` (per-year, per-party annual-report filing-status catalogue — on time / late / non-compliant / not filed — crawled from the gfopp register; the summary carries per-year counts only, for the governance-page tile) |
| `census_2021.json`, `census_2021_settlements.json` | Census aggregates |
| `problem_sections_stats.json` | Risk-neighborhood summary stats |

Files that stay on Firebase Hosting (under `/public/`):

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `articles/` | Long-form `.md` content + image attachments (rendered by react-markdown) |
| `og/` | Pre-generated Open Graph share images |
| `fonts/` | Self-hosted Inter + Fraunces .woff2 |
| `sitemap_*.xml`, `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt` | Crawler artifacts (must be at site origin) |
| favicons, app icons, `site.webmanifest` | PWA + browser chrome |

## Data pipeline (`scripts/`)

The CLI entry point is `scripts/main.ts` (cmd-ts). Flags select which stages to run:

| Flag | Stage |
|---|---|
| `--all` / `-a` | Run every stage below |
| `--prod` / `-p` | Minify output JSON (otherwise pretty-printed for diffability) |
| `--date` / `-d` | Restrict to a single election date `YYYY_MM_DD` |
| `--election` / `-e` | Restrict to a single named election |
| `--reports` / `-r` | Anomaly reports (concentration, turnout, top-gainers/losers, invalid, recount, problem sections) |
| `--stats` / `-s` | National aggregates |
| `--search` / `-c` | Full-text search indices |
| `--financing` / `-f` | Smetna Palata campaign financing |
| `--parties` | Per-party regional/municipal/settlement aggregations + vote swings |
| `--machines` / `-m` | SUEMG voting-machine flash-memory corrections |
| `--candidates` / `-n` | Candidate preferences |
| `--declarations` | MP financial declarations + Commerce Registry → connections graph |
| `--flows` / `-w` | Vote-transition matrices between consecutive elections |
| `--coords` / `-g` | Backfill polling-section GPS coordinates |
| `--summary` / `-u` | Summary-only report regeneration |

`npm run prod` runs `tsx scripts/main.ts --all --prod`.

Pipeline subdirectories of note:

- `parsers/` — CIK results, party canonicalization, candidate dedup
- `parliament/` — scraper for MP photos (re-encoded to .webp via sharp), bios, term history from parliament.bg
- `parliament/rollcall/` + `scrape_rollcall.ts` — roll-call vote ingest (per-session CSVs from stenogram attachments → `data/parliament/votes/sessions/<date>.json`)
- `parliament/derived/` — MP loyalty, MP-MP cosine similarity, per-party cohesion (recomputed weekly from session JSONs)
- `declarations/` — Court-of-Audit property/interest filings + Commerce Registry → MP↔company graph, rankings, per-MP 1-hop subgraphs
- `smetna_palata/` — campaign financing parsing
- `polls/` — Wikipedia scrape + accuracy analysis + narrative generation
- `parties/` — per-party data bundling, AI-generated campaign retrospects, and `build_demographics.ts` (per-party vote↔demographics Pearson correlations across the 265 municipalities → the scatter, fingerprint tile and cleavages tile)
- `voteFlows/` — transition matrices between consecutive elections
- `machines_memory/` — SUEMG flash-memory corrections
- `macro/` — Eurostat + World Bank + curated economic / governance indicators (with absolute-floor + 10% regression check per indicator); also `fetch_bnb_auctions.ts`, which scrapes the BNB Fiscal Agent auction archive (`https://www.bnb.bg/FiscalAgent/FAGSAuctions/FAAuctionResults/`) into `data/debt-emissions-domestic.json` — one row per auction event, handles both EUR and BGN, flags bids-rejected auctions, no parser failures across 2019-present; and `fetch_fiscal_reserve.ts`, the multi-source fiscal-reserve ingest. The Bulgarian Ministry of Finance publishes the фискален резерв figure in three parallel filename series on `minfin.bg/upload/` — `mreport_<Month><YYYY>_bg.pdf` (Институт за анализи и прогнози monthly economic review with a КФП summary table carrying ~12 months of rolling values), `BULETIN_<MonthName>_<YYYY>.pdf` (Информационен бюлетин: Изпълнение на държавния бюджет, narrative press-bulletin with the single end-of-month figure inline), and `FRA-MM-YYYY-BG.xlsx` (authoritative single-month spreadsheet from the dedicated `/bg/statistics/4` page). Live minfin.bg is Cloudflare-WAF blocked, so the script reads everything indirectly via Wayback Machine `id_` URLs; XLSX months past the Wayback cutoff (~Apr 2025) drop manually into `data/_cache/minfin_fr_xlsx/` (see the README there). All three sources flow into a per-month MEDIAN-of-votes step so a single misaligned PDF reading can't poison the series. The XLSX parser detects unit (`(млн. лв.)` vs `(млн. евро)`) and normalises across the 2026-01-01 euro adoption boundary using the fixed currency-board rate; the round-trip is exact and the chart is continuous across the transition.
- `regional/` — oblast-level indicators. `fetch_eurostat.ts` pulls Eurostat NUTS 3 series (per-oblast floor + 10% regression check); `fetch_az_oblast.ts` then merges the АЗ long-term-unemployment share into the same `data/regional.json` (run after the Eurostat fetch — the skill runs both). Drives the `/municipality/<code>` drilldown tile and the `/demographics` regional choropleth.
- `indicators/` — Annual sub-national indicators pulled from multiple BG sources (AZ годишен обзор for registered unemployment, МОН via data.egov.bg for DZI scores, НСИ timeseries XLSX for year-over-year population change and `nsi_vital.ts` for natural population change + net migration). Source-pluggable: `sources/<source>.ts` files normalise to a common shape, `_name_aliases.json` carries the manual code/name overrides, `build.ts` merges to `data/indicators.json` plus per-municipality slices. Floor + match-rate safety checks per source.
- `grao/` — ГРАО settlement-level registered population. `fetch.ts` resolves the latest quarterly `t41nm` table from grao.bg, decodes Windows-1251, parses the per-municipality blocks, joins settlement names → EKATTE via `settlements.json`, and writes `data/grao_population.json` + per-municipality slices.
- `census/` — NSI Census 2021 ingestion (`build_census.ts` parses the NSI XLSX into country/oblast/municipality JSON + the settlement sidecar + per-entity slices)
- `procurement/` — АОП public-procurement ingest. `ingest.ts` walks the data.egov.bg dataset listing for the АОП org, downloads each fortnight bundle (cached gzipped under `raw_data/procurement/`), normalizes the OCDS releases into flat `Contract` rows via `normalize.ts`, writes month-shards under `data/procurement/contracts/`, then rebuilds per-EIK rollups (`rollups.ts`), MP cross-reference (`cross_reference.ts`, EIK-keyed against `companies-index.json`), and the journalism payload (`derived.ts` — top contractors + sankey-shaped flow). `ingest_legacy.ts` handles pre-OCDS annual CSV dumps (2011-2023). Canary fixture + diff-cap + amount sanity checks in `validate.ts`.
- `funds/` — ИСУН EU-funds beneficiary ingest. `ingest.ts` downloads the public "Бенефициенти" XLSX export from `2020.eufunds.bg` — fresh every run, since the export is a single mutable URL — (a snapshot is kept under `data/_cache/funds/` for offline `--file` re-runs), `parse.ts` locates the table by header match and flattens the ~53k organisation rows into `FundsBeneficiary` records, then the ingest shards them by EIK last digit and rebuilds `data/funds/index.json`. `cross_reference.ts` joins the beneficiary EIKs against `companies-index.json` (the MP-tied payload → `derived/mp_connected.json`). Full rebuild every run — the export is an all-time per-organisation rollup, not an event feed — with a header-schema guard + row-count floor in lieu of a canary.
- `budget/` — Bulgarian state-budget ingest. `ingest.ts` is the CLI entry point; three pillars share it. `kfp.ts` parses the data.egov.bg КФП feed (monthly consolidated execution snapshots → `kfp.json`). `law_html.ts` parses each year's State Budget Law from Държавен вестник HTML into per-spending-unit appropriations (admin + program grain at `stage: "law"`) plus the Чл. 1 framework totals (planned revenue tree, Section II/III/IV headlines → `derived/law_framework.json`). `execution_pdf.ts` / `execution_borderless_pdf.ts` / `execution_xlsx.ts` parse each ministry's "Отчет за изпълнението на програмния бюджет" (PDF or XLSX-in-ZIP) — hand-curated in `EXECUTION_REPORTS` per fiscal year — and emit `stage: "amendment"` (уточнен план) + `stage: "execution"` (отчет) facts. `reconcile.ts` joins law + amendment + execution at admin and program grain; `facts.ts` builds economic-grain plan-vs-actual variance from the КФП feed; `cross_reference.ts` joins spending units to procurement awarders; `derived_admin_flow.ts` builds the Sankey payload (per-ministry planned + framework planned revenue/transfers/EU/balance so the admin view tells a coherent planned-vs-planned story); `ministries.ts` slices per-ministry rollups so the ministry screen loads one small file. Six pinned canaries in `validate.ts` (КФП resource, law year, four execution-report formats, economic facts).
- `financing/` — Сметна палата party-financing scrapers. `scrape_index.ts` parses the annual-report year catalogue off bulnao.government.bg → `data/financing/index.json`. `scrape_reports.ts` crawls the gfopp WebForms register — opening an ASP.NET session per year, paginating each of the four per-status GridViews — for the per-party annual-report filing-status catalogue → `data/financing/reports.json` + `reports-summary.json`. Fails loud on truncation (empty newest year, identical per-year counts, sub-floor totals).
- `watch/` — Tier-1 daily watcher (25 upstream sources fingerprint-diffed → daily markdown report under `data-reports/` + per-source state under `state/watch/`, see "Continuous data refresh" below)
- `lib/upload.ts` — shared GCS upload helpers (gzipped text via `gsutil cp -Z`, binaries as-is)
- `lib/ingest-state.ts` — per-skill ingest-marker helpers consumed by `scripts/stamp-ingest.ts` and the `/process-watch-report` orchestrator
- `fonts/fetch-fonts.mjs` — one-shot fetcher for self-hosted Inter + Fraunces
- `reports/`, `party_stats/`, `preferences/`, `search/`, `stats/`, `recount/` — analytical and aggregation stages
- `og/`, `prerender/`, `sitemap/`, `images/`, `llms/` — build-time output (run from `postbuild`)

Some narrative content is generated with LLMs:

- `polls:gen-analysis` calls Anthropic Claude (requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- `party:gen-retrospect` calls Google Gemini (requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`)

Both are written to JSON consumed by the SPA — there are no LLM calls at runtime.

## Maintenance skills (Claude Code)

For contributors using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), the repo includes project-specific skills under `.claude/skills/` for the recurring data-refresh workflows:

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `process-watch-report` | Orchestrator. Compares `state/watch/*.json` against `state/ingest/*.json` and runs every tier-2 skill whose mapped sources have changed since its last successful ingest. Survives multi-day gaps. |
| `update-connections` | Refresh MP declarations + Commerce Registry, rebuild the connections graph, flag suspicious declared values. |
| `update-officials` | Refresh non-MP declarations (cabinet, state-agency heads, regional governors) from the same Court-of-Audit register; reuses the MP declarations parser, writes per-slug files + `index.json` + `assets-rankings.json` under `data/officials/`. |
| `update-polls` | Scrape new polls from Wikipedia, recompute accuracy, write the per-election narrative. |
| `update-rollcall` | Ingest new parliament.bg roll-call vote sessions. Validates against a canary fixture; tracks unresolved MP ids without dropping them. |
| `update-financing` | Refresh the Сметна палата party-financing data: `scrape_index.ts` for the annual-report year index (`data/financing/index.json`), and `scrape_reports.ts` for the per-party filing-status catalogue (`data/financing/reports.json` — on time / late / non-compliant / not filed, 2011 onward, crawled from the gfopp register). |
| `update-macro` | Refresh `data/macro.json` from Eurostat + World Bank + curated tables. |
| `update-regional` | Refresh `data/regional.json` — Eurostat NUTS 3 per-oblast GDP/capita, population, net migration, plus long-term-unemployment share merged from Агенция по заетостта (runs the Eurostat fetch then the АЗ merge). |
| `update-indicators` | Refresh `data/indicators.json` — annual per-municipality indicators: registered unemployment (Агенция по заетостта), DZI matura scores (МОН via data.egov.bg), and natural population change + net migration (НСИ vital statistics). Source-pluggable; new annual sub-national indicators slot in with one source file. |
| `update-census` | Rebuild the NSI Census 2021 JSON (`census_2021.json`, the settlement sidecar, per-entity slices) from the raw NSI XLSX. Event-driven — fresh clone, an NSI re-release, a new dimension, or the 2031 census. |
| `update-grao` | Refresh `data/grao_population.json` + per-municipality slices — quarterly ГРАО settlement-level registered population (permanent + current address), joined to EKATTE. |
| `update-procurement` | Ingest АОП fortnight OCDS bundles from data.egov.bg into `data/procurement/`. Normalizes releases into per-month `Contract` shards, rebuilds per-contractor / per-awarder rollups, runs the MP cross-reference (EIK-joined against `companies-index.json`) to surface contracts going to companies tied to sitting MPs, derives the awarder→contractor concentration index for the risk-score, and (Step 5) refreshes the АОП debarred-suppliers snapshot via `scripts/procurement/debarred.ts`. Canary-pinned with a diff-cap; pre-OCDS years (2011-2023) are backfilled via the sibling `procurement:ingest-legacy` script. |
| `update-funds` | Ingest the ИСУН 2020 EU-funds beneficiary register from `2020.eufunds.bg` into `data/funds/`. Full re-export each run (all-time per-organisation rollups: contracts signed, funds contracted, funds paid); header-schema guard + 40k row-count floor in lieu of a canary; runs the MP cross-reference (EIK-joined against `companies-index.json`) to surface EU-funds beneficiaries tied to sitting MPs. |
| `update-budget` | Ingest state-budget data into `data/budget/`. Two ingest paths share one CLI: the data.egov.bg КФП feed (consolidated execution time series + monthly snapshots) and per-ministry "Отчет за изпълнението на програмния бюджет" reports (admin + program grain reconciled against the State Budget Law). Six pinned canaries; admin-grain sanity checks per ministry. |
| `parliament-scrape` | Scrape MP photos/bios/seat data from parliament.bg (run after a new parliament is seated). |
| `party-retrospect` | Generate per-party campaign retrospects. |

Every tier-2 ingest skill has a "Data-integrity contract" section in its `SKILL.md` enumerating fail-loud surfaces (HTTP errors, schema drift, canary mismatch, count-floor / regression breaches) and intentional non-fatal skips. The orchestrator halts on first downstream failure and refuses to stamp `state/ingest/<skill>.json` until a clean run.

These can also be run by hand via the npm scripts and the `scripts/` CLI flags listed above.

## Continuous data refresh

Two-tier model.

**Tier 1 — daily watcher.** `npm run watch` (`scripts/watch/index.ts`) fingerprint-diffs 25 upstream sources (parliament.bg MPs + votes, BG Wikipedia polls, register.cacbg.bg declarations — MP slice, register.cacbg.bg declarations — executive officials slice, Сметна палата party financing, Сметна палата annual-report year index, data.egov.bg Commerce Registry, data.egov.bg АОП procurement, АОП debarred-suppliers register, ИСУН EU-funds public beneficiary register, data.egov.bg КФП state-budget execution, per-ministry "Отчет за изпълнението на програмния бюджет", Eurostat macro (15 datasets including FDI flows), Eurostat regional NUTS 3, EC "EU spending and revenue" per-Member-State XLSX, BNB domestic ДЦК auctions, **minfin.bg КФП monthly bulletins via Wayback** (mreport + BULETIN PDFs + FRA-MM-YYYY-(BG\|EN).xlsx — feeds the fiscal-reserve series), Агенция по заетостта годишен обзор, МОН ДЗИ via data.egov.bg, НСИ population timeseries, НСИ births/deaths/migration timeseries, ГРАО settlement registered population, Transparency International CPI, World Bank WGI) and writes:
- `data-reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` + `data-reports/latest.md` — human-readable daily snapshot
- `state/watch/<source>.json` — per-source `lastChanged` + `lastChecked`

Each source declares a `cadence` (`daily` / `weekly` / `monthly`); the runner honours it by skipping a source whose `lastChecked` is younger than the cadence window. The watcher itself still runs daily, but a "monthly" source like Transparency International CPI is only actually fingerprinted once every ~29 days — handy for annual-release upstreams that don't move often.

Scheduled via a local Claude Desktop routine — runs from the contributor's machine so source-blocking on cloud-runner IPs (data.egov.bg in particular) doesn't apply. CIK is omitted in v1; its endpoint sits behind Cloudflare and needs a Playwright-based fetch.

**Tier 2 — on-demand ingest.** Tell Claude Code `process-watch-report` (or "sync data based on the watcher"). The orchestrator compares `state/watch/*.json` against `state/ingest/<skill>.json` and runs only the skills whose mapped sources have advanced since their last successful ingest. Multi-day gaps are handled correctly — the decision is state-driven, not based on the latest report file alone.

`.github/workflows/` keeps two workflow_dispatch-only jobs for heavier ingest paths that need the bucket service account:

| Workflow | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ingest-rollcall.yml` | `workflow_dispatch` + `repository_dispatch` | Runs `scrape_rollcall.ts` end-to-end (validates against the canary fixture, uploads to the bucket). Same skill as `/update-rollcall` but from CI. |
| `rebuild-derived.yml` | weekly Sunday 23:00 UTC | Recomputes loyalty / similarity / cohesion from the accumulated session JSONs. |
| `test.yml` | on PRs | Lint + Playwright. |

See `docs/plans/data-watch-ingest-pipeline.md` for the full spec.

## Environment variables

`.env.local` (gitignored — secrets):

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...   # only for npm run polls:gen-analysis
GEMINI_API_KEY=...      # only for npm run party:gen-retrospect
```

Both keys are optional unless you're regenerating the AI-written narratives. (`vite.config.ts` historically injected `GEMINI_API_KEY` into the frontend bundle as `process.env.API_KEY`, but no `src/` code currently consumes it.)

`.env.production` (committed — public bucket URL):

```
VITE_DATA_BASE_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/data-electionsbg-com
```

Empty in dev so the Vite middleware serves data from local `/data/`. The `dataUrl()` helper handles both cases transparently.

## Deployment

The SPA shell deploys to Firebase Hosting; the data layer syncs to the GCS bucket.

**Firebase Hosting (SPA shell):**

- `npm run deploy` → production (`elections-bg`)
- `npm run staging` → staging (`electionsbg-staging`)
- `npm run deploy:fast` / `npm run staging:fast` → skip the predeploy data pipeline (`SKIP_PREDEPLOY=1`)

Both run the full data pipeline as `predeploy` unless skipped. SPA rewrites and per-route prerendering are configured in `firebase.json`; prerendered HTML (~445k files: per-candidate, per-section, per-settlement) is generated by `scripts/prerender/` during `postbuild` so crawlers see populated `<meta>` tags.

**GCS bucket (data layer):**

- `npm run bucket:sync` → incremental rsync of `data/` (text gzipped via `-j json,svg,xml,txt,html,css,md`, binaries as-is)
- `npm run bucket:sync:dry` → preview without uploading

After most data updates (new polls, scraped roll-calls, refreshed declarations) only the bucket needs to update — no Firebase deploy. Deploy time for SPA changes alone is ~20 min; data-only updates are seconds.

Bucket conventions:
- Cache-Control: `public, max-age=3600, stale-while-revalidate=604800`
- Content-Encoding: `gzip` for text via `gsutil cp -Z` / `rsync -j`
- CORS: open `GET, HEAD` from all SPA origins (see `scripts/gcs-cors.json`)

### Election integrity

- [Anti-Corruption Fund (ACF)](https://acf.bg/) — risk-section analysis. Together with Bulgarian media reporting (Sega, Svobodna Evropa) and the [OSCE/ODIHR election-observation reports](https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/bulgaria), it informs the curated list of risk neighborhoods (Roma-majority areas with the highest reported incidence of controlled / corporate voting) tracked by the risk-screening reports. The per-section risk score, the cross-election swing signal, and the risk-cluster map are all *derived* — computed from the CIK results above, not fetched from an external source.

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome.

- For SPA changes: `npm run lint && npm run build` then `npm test` (Playwright). The lint check is part of `predeploy`.
- For data-pipeline changes: run `npm run prod` locally and diff the resulting JSON against `git`. The roll-call ingest has a canary regression fixture at `tests/fixtures/parliament/votes/canary.json` — `npm run rollcall:scrape` validates against it and fails loud if the parser drifts.
- For new upstream sources: add a module under `scripts/watch/sources/` following the existing pattern, then a sibling `/update-<source>` skill under `.claude/skills/` for the ingest. See `docs/plans/data-watch-ingest-pipeline.md` for the full spec.
- Open PRDs and roadmap items live under `docs/plans/`.
